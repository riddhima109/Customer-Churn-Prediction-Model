# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
## Model Details
**Model Name:** Customer Churn Prediction Model 

**Developer:** Riddhima Bansal

**Model Date:** August 10, 2024

**Model Version:** 1.0

**Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network - Classification Model

**Model Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras

## Model Objective
This Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is designed to predict customer churn in a telecommunications setting. By identifying customers at risk of churning, the model facilitates timely and targeted retention efforts, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer loyalty.

**Use Case:**
* **Primary Goal**: Predict customer churn to enable proactive and timely interventions.
* **Target Users:** Customer Relationship Managers, Data Analysts, Data Science Teams within the telecommunications industry.

## Model Input & Output
* **Input:** The RNN model processes sequences of customer-related data, including demographics, account status, service usage, and billing information. The input features are numerically encoded or categorized.
* **Output:** The model provides a binary classification (0 or 1) where 1 indicates a prediction that the customer will churn and 0 indicates the customer will remain.

Prediction: A binary classification where:

1 = High risk of churn

0 = Low or no risk of churn

## Model Architecture: 
#### Algorithm:
The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data. It consists of input layers, hidden layers with recurrent connections, and an output layer. The hidden layers process the sequential data one step at a time, with the hidden state at each step capturing information from previous steps. This allows the model to learn temporal dependencies within the data.

**Feature Engineering:**

#### Preprocessing Steps:
* Categorical features were encoded using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
* Numerical features were standardized for consistency across inputs.
* Sequential data was structured to capture time-based patterns in customer behavior.

#### Network Architecture:
* **Input Layer:** Handles the sequential input data, with each time step corresponding to a different feature vector.
* **Recurrent Layers:** Composed of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) cells that process the input sequence, capturing dependencies over time.
* **Output Layer:** A single neuron activated by a sigmoid function to produce a probability output for binary classification.

## Training and Evaluation Data

#### Training Data:
* Source: Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn dataset.
* Composition: Includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, account status, and churn indicators. The data is organized into sequences to capture time-based customer behavior.
* Split: The data was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for evaluation.

#### Evaluation Data:
* Consistency: The same preprocessing steps were applied to the test set, ensuring consistency in model evaluation.

## Performance Metrics:
The RNN model's performance is measured using various metrics calculated on the test dataset after training:

Accuracy: 80%

Precision: 66%

Recall: 58%

F1-Score: 62%


**Evaluation:**
**Confusion Matrix:** Provides insights into the model's classification accuracy by showing counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**ROC Curve:** Illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, with an AUC of 0.91 indicating strong performance.

## Limitations
* RNNs can be challenging to train, especially with long sequences, as they may suffer from vanishing or exploding gradient problems.
* They require substantial computational resources, particularly when dealing with large datasets or long sequences.

**Alternative Approaches:**
Consider using more advanced architectures like Transformer models for handling longer sequences or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) if sequence processing is less critical.

## Trade-offs
RNNs are excellent at capturing temporal dependencies and sequential patterns, but they can be computationally expensive and require careful tuning. They are also less interpretable compared to simpler models.

## Ethical Considerations
* **Bias and fairness:** It is crucial to ensure that the RNN model does not introduce or amplify biases towards any specific customer group. Performance metrics are monitored across different segments to ensure fairness.

## Deployment and Maintenance
* **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Initial Deployment: The model is intended for use as a decision-support tool for customer retention strategies, focusing on timely interventions for high-risk customers.
  - Maintenance: Regular retraining with new customer data is recommended to maintain the model's accuracy and relevance.

* **Model Monitoring:**
  - Performance Tracking: Continuous monitoring of model performance is essential to detect and mitigate any drift in prediction accuracy.
  - Ethical Monitoring: Regular reviews ensure that the modelâ€™s outputs remain fair and unbiased, with necessary updates made as needed.

## Caveats and Recommendations
* **Model Limitations:** RNNs, particularly when not carefully tuned, can struggle with long sequences and may require substantial computational resources. For datasets with less temporal dependency, simpler models may suffice.
* **Usage Recommendations:** Ideal for scenarios where capturing temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data is crucial. For simpler use cases, other models like Decision Trees or Random Forests might be more appropriate.
