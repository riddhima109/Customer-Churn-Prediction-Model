# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
**Overview**
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict customer churnâ€”the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's products or services over a given period. The project employs various algorithms to analyze customer behavior and transaction data, identifying key indicators of churn. Algorithms implemented include Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN. This project is designed to run on Google Colab, providing a convenient environment for running and experimenting with the models.
