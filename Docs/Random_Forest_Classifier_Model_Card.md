# Random Forest Classifier Model Card
## Model Details
**Model Name:** Customer Churn Prediction Model

**Developer:** Riddhima Bansal

**Model Date:** August 10, 2024

**Model Version:** 1.0

**Model Type:** Random Forest - Classification Model

**Model Framework:** scikit-learn / sklearn

## Model Objective
This Random Forest Classifier model is developed to predict customer churn in a telecommunications setting. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the model supports targeted retention efforts, aiming to reduce churn rates and enhance customer loyalty.

**Use Case:**
* **Primary Goal**: Predict customer churn to enable effective intervention strategies.
* **Target Users:** Customer Relationship Managers, Data Analysts, Data Science Teams within the telecommunications industry.

## Model Input & Output
* **Input:** The Random Forest model takes customer demographics, account status, service usage, and billing information as input features, all of which are numerically encoded or categorized.
* **Output:** The model provides a binary classification (0 or 1) where 1 indicates a prediction that the customer will churn and 0 indicates the customer will remain.

Prediction: A binary classification where:

1 = High risk of churn

0 = Low or no risk of churn

## Model Architecture: 
#### Algorithm:
The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It uses techniques like bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and random feature selection to improve performance and generalization.

**Feature Engineering:**

#### Preprocessing Steps:
* Categorical features were encoded using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
* Numerical features were standardized for consistency.
* Missing values were handled through imputation or removal to maintain data quality.

## Training and Evaluation Data

#### Training Data:
* Source: Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn dataset.
* Composition: Contains customer demographics, service subscriptions, account status, and churn indicators.
* Split: The data was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for evaluation.

#### Evaluation Data:
* Consistency: The same preprocessing procedures were applied to the test set to ensure reliable model evaluation.

## Performance Metrics:
The Random Forest Classifier's performance is measured using various metrics calculated on the test dataset after training:

Accuracy: 79%

Precision: 66%

Recall: 48%

F1-Score: 56%

AUC-ROC: 83%

**Evaluation:**
**Confusion Matrix:** Provides insights into the model's classification performance by showing counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**ROC Curve:** Illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, with an AUC of 0.90 indicating strong performance.

## Limitations
* Random Forest models can be computationally intensive, especially with a large number of trees or features.
* They may suffer from reduced interpretability compared to simpler models like Decision Trees due to their ensemble nature.

**Alternative Approaches:**
Consider other ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or more complex models like Neural Networks for different trade-offs in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Trade-offs
Random Forests provide improved accuracy and robustness by averaging multiple decision trees, which helps in reducing overfitting compared to individual decision trees. However, they can be less interpretable and more computationally demanding.

## Ethical Considerations
* **Bias and fairness:** Ensuring that the Random Forest model does not exhibit unfair bias towards specific customer groups is important. Performance metrics are monitored across different segments to ensure fairness.

## Deployment and Maintenance
* **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Initial Deployment: The model is used to support customer retention strategies by identifying high-risk customers.
  - Maintenance: Regular updates and retraining with new data are recommended to keep the model accurate and relevant.

* **Model Monitoring:**
  - Performance Tracking: Continuous monitoring of model performance is essential to detect any drift in prediction accuracy.
  - Ethical Monitoring: Regular reviews ensure that the modelâ€™s outputs remain fair and unbiased, with necessary updates made as needed.

## Caveats and Recommendations
* **Model Limitations:** Random Forests, while robust, may require substantial computational resources and can be less interpretable. For complex scenarios, exploring other ensemble methods or deep learning models may be beneficial.
* **Usage Recommendations:** Ideal for scenarios requiring high accuracy and robustness. Suitable for medium to large datasets where interpretability is less critical compared to model performance.
