# Transformer Model Card
## Model Details
**Model Name:** Customer Churn Prediction Model 

**Developer:** Riddhima Bansal

**Model Date:** August 10, 2024

**Model Version:** 1.0

**Model Type:** Transformer - Classification Model

**Model Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras

## Model Objective
This Transformer model is designed to predict customer churn in a telecommunications setting. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the model supports targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates and enhancing customer loyalty.

**Use Case:**
* **Primary Goal:** Predict customer churn to enable proactive retention strategies.
* **Target Users:** Customer Relationship Managers, Data Analysts, Data Science Teams within the telecommunications industry.

## Model Input & Output
* **Input:** The Transformer model processes sequences of customer data, including demographics, account status, service usage, and billing information. These sequences are tokenized and embedded into high-dimensional vectors suitable for model processing.
* **Output:** The model provides a binary classification (0 or 1) where 1 indicates a prediction that the customer will churn and 0 indicates the customer will remain.

Prediction: A binary classification where:

1 = High risk of churn

0 = Low or no risk of churn

## Model Architecture: 
#### Algorithm:
The Transformer architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, enabling the model to capture relationships between features across the entire sequence. This makes it particularly well-suited for sequential and time-series data.

**Feature Engineering:**

#### Preprocessing Steps:
* Categorical features were encoded using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding.
* Numerical features were standardized to ensure uniformity across inputs.
* Sequential data was tokenized and embedded to create a rich representation of customer behavior over time.

#### Network Architecture:
* **Input Layer:** Handles the embedded input sequences.
* **Transformer Encoder Layers:** Multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks that process the input sequence. Each layer applies attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between different parts of the sequence.
* **Output Layer:** A single neuron activated by a sigmoid function to produce a probability output for binary classification.

## Training and Evaluation Data

#### Training Data:
* Source: Kaggle's Telco Customer Churn dataset.
* Composition: Includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, account status, and churn indicators. The data is organized into sequences for Transformer processing.
* Split: The data was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for evaluation.

#### Evaluation Data:
* Consistency: The same preprocessing steps were applied to the test set, ensuring consistency in model evaluation.

## Performance Metrics:
The Transformer's performance is measured using various metrics calculated on the test dataset after training:

Accuracy: 75%

Precision: 58%

Recall: 45%

F1-Score: 50%

**Evaluation:**
**Confusion Matrix:** Provides insights into the model's classification accuracy by showing counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**ROC Curve:** Illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, with an AUC of 0.95 indicating excellent performance.

## Limitations
* Transformers require substantial computational resources, particularly for large datasets or when using deep architectures with many layers.
* They can be complex to tune and require a significant amount of data for effective training.

**Alternative Approaches:**
For scenarios with limited data or resources, consider simpler models like RNNs or CNNs. For cases with non-sequential data, traditional models like Random Forests may be more suitable.

## Trade-offs
Transformers excel at capturing complex relationships within sequential data, making them highly effective for time-series and other sequence-based tasks. However, they are resource-intensive and require careful tuning.

## Ethical Considerations
* **Bias and fairness:** It is crucial to ensure that the Transformer model does not introduce or amplify biases towards any specific customer group. Performance metrics are monitored across different segments to promote fairness.

## Deployment and Maintenance
* **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Initial Deployment: The model is intended for use as a decision-support tool for customer retention strategies, focusing on high-risk customers.
  - Maintenance: Regular retraining with new data is recommended to maintain model accuracy and relevance.

* **Model Monitoring:**
  - Performance Tracking: Continuous monitoring of the model’s performance is essential to detect and mitigate any drift in prediction accuracy.
  - Ethical Monitoring: Regular reviews ensure that the model’s outputs remain fair and unbiased, with necessary updates made as needed.

## Caveats and Recommendations
* **Model Limitations:** While Transformers are powerful, they require significant computational resources and can be complex to implement. For less complex use cases, consider simpler models that are easier to interpret and maintain.
* **Usage Recommendations:** Ideal for scenarios where capturing intricate relationships within sequential data is crucial. For more straightforward tasks, simpler models may offer sufficient performance with lower resource requirements.
